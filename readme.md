# Inboxify

A Firefox/Chrome addon to make Gmail feel like Inbox.

## Why?

Google killed Inbox in March 2019. Inbox turned out to be an experiment to improve Gmail, and Inbox's users were left in the dark. Gmail, while operating in a similar fashion to Inbox, is not the same. This extension aims to change that.

## What does it do?

- Rename and reskin Archive to become Done
- Add a Done category in the left hand toolbar
- Reskin Gmail to look more like Inbox

### What doesn't work?

- Reminders. Google hasn't exposed any sort of API for them so they can't be implemented as of yet.
- Other themes.
- Label color for Done.
- Some other features that would require a major UI overhaul.

## Setup

1. Change Gmail to the Default theme.
2. Create a custom label named `done_replace_string`. Do not assign a color.
3. Install the extension and refresh Gmail.
4. You're done!
